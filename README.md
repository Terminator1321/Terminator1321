## Hi, I'm Rohan Das

Developer focused on AI/ML research, systems programming, and building software from first principles.

I primarily work with C++, Python, and TensorFlow, with strong interests in machine learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and game AI. I enjoy designing custom neural networks, AI pipelines, and experimental tools where I can understand and control the system at a low level rather than relying on high-level abstractions.

My work emphasizes implementation-driven learning, custom engines, and performance-aware design.

### Current Focus
- Building custom neural networks and AI models from scratch
- Reinforcement learning agents for games and simulations
- Computer vision systems for real-time analysis
- Node-based tools, editors, and engine-level systems in C++

### Interests
- AI systems and applied ML research
- Game AI and simulation
- Low-level architecture and performance optimization
- Experimental and research-oriented projects

Most of my repositories reflect hands-on experimentation, where learning comes from implementing ideas end-to-end rather than using pre-built frameworks.
